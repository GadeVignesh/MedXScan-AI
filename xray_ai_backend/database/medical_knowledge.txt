[Disease: Pneumonia]
Definition: Pneumonia is a serious infection of one or both lungs in which the air sacs (alveoli) fill with pus, fluid, or inflammatory material, impairing oxygen exchange.
Causes: Bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella), viral (influenza, COVID-19, RSV), fungal (Aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii in immunocompromised patients), or aspiration of food/liquids.
X-ray Findings: Lobar or segmental consolidation appearing as white opacification. Air bronchograms may be visible within consolidated areas. Can be unilateral or bilateral depending on severity.
Symptoms: High fever (38–40°C), productive cough with yellow or green sputum, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, chills, decreased breath sounds on auscultation.
Diagnosis: Chest X-ray, sputum culture, blood cultures, CBC showing elevated WBC, procalcitonin levels. CT chest for complex cases.
Treatment: Antibiotics for bacterial (amoxicillin, azithromycin, fluoroquinolones), antivirals for viral pneumonia, antifungals for fungal types. Oxygen support if SpO2 < 94%, IV fluids, hospitalization for severe cases.
Complications: Sepsis, respiratory failure, lung abscess, pleural empyema, bacteremia.
Prognosis: Good with timely treatment. Mortality increases with age, comorbidities, and delayed care.
When to Seek Care: High fever exceeding 39°C, difficulty breathing, confusion, persistent chest pain, or SpO2 below 92%.
Prevention: Pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine, good hand hygiene, smoking cessation.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Pleural Effusion]
Definition: Pleural effusion is abnormal accumulation of fluid (transudate or exudate) in the pleural space between the lung and chest wall.
Causes: Transudate — heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome. Exudate — infection (parapneumonic), malignancy, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis).
X-ray Findings: Blunting of costophrenic angles (>200 mL fluid needed), homogeneous opacity at lung base, meniscus sign, mediastinal shift away from effusion in large collections, or shift toward effusion in trapped lung.
Symptoms: Progressive shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds at lung base, dullness to percussion, pleuritic chest pain (with inflammatory causes), dry cough.
Diagnosis: Chest X-ray, ultrasound (detects as little as 20 mL), CT chest, thoracentesis with fluid analysis (LDH, protein, cell count, culture, cytology).
Treatment: Treat underlying cause. Thoracentesis for symptomatic relief or diagnostic sampling. Pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusions.
Complications: Empyema if infected, trapped lung, respiratory failure from large untreated effusions.
When to Seek Care: Severe breathing difficulty, rapid accumulation, signs of infection (fever, purulent fluid).

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Pneumothorax]
Definition: Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, causing partial or complete lung collapse.
Types: Spontaneous (primary — young tall males, no lung disease; secondary — underlying lung disease), traumatic, tension (medical emergency — air accumulates under pressure).
Causes: Rupture of subpleural blebs, trauma (rib fracture, penetrating injury), iatrogenic (post-procedure), COPD, Marfan syndrome, cystic fibrosis.
X-ray Findings: Visible pleural line (thin white line) with absent lung markings peripheral to it. Tracheal deviation away from affected side in tension pneumothorax. Hyperlucency on affected side.
Symptoms: Sudden sharp ipsilateral chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance on percussion. Tension pneumothorax: hypotension, tachycardia, tracheal deviation, cyanosis — emergency.
Diagnosis: Chest X-ray (expiratory film increases sensitivity), ultrasound (absence of lung sliding), CT chest for occult cases.
Treatment: Small (<2cm): observation and oxygen. Large or symptomatic: needle aspiration or chest tube (intercostal drain). Tension pneumothorax: immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube.
When to Seek Care: Any sudden unexplained chest pain and breathlessness. Immediate emergency if signs of tension pneumothorax.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Atelectasis]
Definition: Atelectasis is collapse or incomplete inflation of a portion of the lung, reducing gas exchange capacity.
Types: Resorptive (airway obstruction), compressive (pleural effusion, tumor), contraction (fibrosis), adhesive (surfactant deficiency).
Causes: Mucus plugging, foreign body, tumor obstructing airway, post-surgical (anesthesia reduces surfactant), prolonged bed rest, pain-limited breathing.
X-ray Findings: Increased opacity (white density), volume loss on affected side, elevated hemidiaphragm, mediastinal shift toward collapse, compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent lung.
Symptoms: Mild to moderate dyspnea, reduced breath sounds, dullness on percussion. Often asymptomatic if small.
Treatment: Incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, bronchoscopy to remove obstruction, early ambulation post-surgery.
When to Seek Care: Persistent breathing issues, fever suggesting secondary infection, worsening hypoxia.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Cardiomegaly]
Definition: Cardiomegaly is enlargement of the heart defined as a cardiothoracic ratio greater than 0.5 on chest X-ray.

X-ray Findings: Homogeneous white opacity with air bronchograms (air-filled bronchi visible within solid density), lobar or segmental distribution, no volume loss (distinguishes from atelectasis).
Symptoms: Productive cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, bronchial breath sounds, increased vocal resonance on auscultation.
Treatment: Antibiotics for infectious consolidation. Treat specific underlying cause. Monitor resolution on follow-up imaging (4–6 weeks).
When to Seek Care: Persistent symptoms beyond 5–7 days, worsening hypoxia, systemic sepsis signs.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Lung Lesion]
Definition: A lung lesion is a broad term for any abnormal tissue change within the lung visible on imaging, ranging from benign to malignant.
Types: Nodule (<3cm), mass (>3cm), cavity, cyst, ground-glass opacity.
Causes: Infection (TB granuloma, fungal infection), primary lung cancer, metastatic cancer, hamartoma (benign), carcinoid tumor, abscess.
X-ray Findings: Focal opacity, shadow, or density. Spiculated edges suggest malignancy. Smooth well-defined borders suggest benign. Cavitation suggests abscess or TB.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic initially. May present with persistent cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, chest pain in malignant cases.
Diagnosis: CT chest (characterization), PET scan (metabolic activity), bronchoscopy, CT-guided biopsy, sputum cytology.
When to Seek Care: Persistent cough >3 weeks, unexplained weight loss, hemoptysis, or any new lesion found on imaging — prompt follow-up essential.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Lung Opacity]
Definition: Lung opacity is a non-specific radiological finding describing increased radiodensity in lung tissue, appearing as white areas on X-ray.
Types: Ground-glass opacity (GGO — hazy, vessels still visible), consolidation (dense, vessels obscured), reticular pattern, nodular pattern.
Causes: Infection (pneumonia, COVID-19), pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, interstitial lung disease, malignancy, atelectasis, aspiration.
X-ray Findings: White or grey areas of varying density. Distribution (unilateral/bilateral, upper/lower lobe), pattern, and associated features guide diagnosis.
Symptoms: Depends entirely on the underlying cause — may range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure.
When to Seek Care: Any new lung opacity on imaging requires clinical correlation. Seek care if accompanied by fever, dyspnea, or systemic symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Lung Mass]
Definition: A lung mass is a pulmonary lesion measuring greater than 3 cm in diameter, which carries a higher probability of malignancy than a nodule.
Causes: Primary lung cancer (non-small cell: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell; small cell), pulmonary carcinoid, metastatic disease from breast, colon, kidney, or melanoma, lung abscess, fungal ball (aspergilloma).
X-ray Findings: Rounded or irregular dense opacity >3cm. Spiculated (irregular spiky) margins, pleural tethering, or mediastinal involvement suggest malignancy. Cavitation with thick walls suggests abscess or squamous cell carcinoma.
Symptoms: Persistent cough, hemoptysis (coughing blood), unintentional weight loss, chest pain, dyspnea, recurrent pneumonia, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), superior vena cava syndrome in advanced disease.
Diagnosis: CT chest with contrast, PET-CT for staging, bronchoscopy, CT-guided biopsy, mediastinoscopy.
Treatment: Depends on histology and stage. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy for lung cancer.
When to Seek Care: Any mass found on imaging requires urgent specialist referral. Do not delay — early stage treatment dramatically improves survival.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Pulmonary Nodule]
Definition: A pulmonary nodule is a rounded opacity ≤3 cm in the lung. The majority are benign but require monitoring based on size, characteristics, and risk factors.
Causes: Benign — granuloma (healed TB, histoplasmosis), hamartoma, arteriovenous malformation. Malignant — primary lung cancer, metastasis.
X-ray Findings: Small rounded or oval opacity. Size, density (solid, part-solid, ground-glass), margins (smooth vs spiculated), and calcification pattern help assess malignancy risk.
Diagnosis: Low-dose CT (LDCT) for characterization. Fleischner Society guidelines dictate follow-up intervals based on size and risk.
When to Seek Care: All newly discovered nodules require radiological follow-up. High-risk features (>8mm, spiculated, smoker) require urgent CT and possible PET/biopsy.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Pulmonary Fibrosis]
Definition: Pulmonary fibrosis is progressive scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue causing irreversible stiffness and reduced gas exchange capacity.
Types: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF — most severe), secondary fibrosis from connective tissue disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced, radiation.
Causes: Unknown (IPF), autoimmune (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus), repeated environmental exposures (bird droppings, mold), medications (amiodarone, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin), radiation therapy.
X-ray Findings: Bilateral basal reticular (net-like) pattern, honeycombing (end-stage), reduced lung volumes, traction bronchiectasis on HRCT.
Symptoms: Progressive exertional dyspnea (the cardinal symptom), dry non-productive cough, fatigue, clubbing of fingers, fine inspiratory crackles (Velcro crackles) at lung bases.
Diagnosis: HRCT chest (gold standard — UIP pattern), pulmonary function tests (restrictive pattern: reduced FVC, DLCO), lung biopsy if diagnosis uncertain.
Treatment: Antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, nintedanib) slow progression in IPF. Treat underlying cause in secondary fibrosis. Oxygen therapy for hypoxia. Lung transplant for end-stage disease.
Prognosis: IPF median survival 3–5 years from diagnosis. Early treatment and close monitoring essential.
When to Seek Care: Worsening exertional breathlessness, new dry cough, or Velcro crackles on examination.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Emphysema]
Definition: Emphysema is permanent enlargement and destruction of the alveolar air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, causing air trapping and loss of elastic recoil.
Causes: Smoking (>90% of cases), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (genetic cause in young non-smokers), occupational dust and chemical exposure, air pollution.
X-ray Findings: Hyperinflated lungs (increased AP diameter), flattened hemidiaphragms, increased retrosternal airspace, attenuated (thin) vascular markings, bullae (large air spaces).
Symptoms: Progressive chronic breathlessness (initially on exertion, later at rest), barrel chest, use of accessory muscles, pursed-lip breathing, reduced breath sounds, prolonged expiration, weight loss in advanced disease.
Diagnosis: Spirometry (obstructive pattern: FEV1/FVC <0.7, reduced FEV1), HRCT chest shows parenchymal destruction, DLCO reduced.
Treatment: Smoking cessation (most important). Bronchodilators (LABA, LAMA), inhaled corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy for chronic hypoxia, bullectomy or lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients, lung transplant for end-stage.
When to Seek Care: Worsening breathlessness, acute exacerbation with increased cough/sputum/wheeze, SpO2 <88%.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Pleural Thickening]
Definition: Pleural thickening is scarring and fibrosis of the pleural lining, reducing lung expansion and compliance.
Causes: Previous hemothorax or empyema, asbestos exposure (most common occupational cause — may indicate mesothelioma risk), tuberculosis, previous pleuritis, trauma, radiation therapy.
X-ray Findings: Dense white pleural lines along the chest wall, blunted costophrenic angles, calcified pleural plaques (asbestos-related), reduced lung volume on affected side.
Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic in mild cases. Exertional dyspnea with extensive thickening, restrictive lung function on PFTs.
When to Seek Care: New respiratory symptoms in setting of known asbestos exposure requires urgent evaluation for mesothelioma. Regular monitoring if occupational history present.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Diaphragmatic Hernia]
Definition: Diaphragmatic hernia is abnormal protrusion of abdominal organs (stomach, bowel, spleen) through a defect in the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity.
Types: Congenital (Bochdalek — posterior; Morgagni — anterior), acquired (traumatic), hiatal hernia (stomach through esophageal hiatus).
Causes: Congenital diaphragmatic defect (CDH), blunt or penetrating abdominal/chest trauma, raised intra-abdominal pressure (obesity, pregnancy).
X-ray Findings: Gas-filled loops of bowel or stomach visible in chest cavity, elevation of hemidiaphragm, mediastinal shift, absent or abnormal diaphragm outline.
Symptoms: Respiratory distress (severe in neonatal CDH), chest pain, dysphagia, recurrent pulmonary infections, GI symptoms (vomiting, obstruction).
Treatment: Surgical repair is definitive. Neonatal CDH is a surgical emergency.
When to Seek Care: Immediate evaluation for unexplained bowel sounds in chest, respiratory distress, or traumatic chest injury.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Enlarged Cardiomediastinum / Mediastinal Widening]
Definition: Mediastinal widening is broadening of the mediastinal shadow beyond normal limits (>8cm on PA chest X-ray at aortic knuckle level).
Causes: Aortic aneurysm or dissection (emergency), lymphoma or other mediastinal tumors, thymoma, sarcoidosis with lymphadenopathy, substernal goiter, pericardial effusion, traumatic aortic injury.
X-ray Findings: Broad mediastinal silhouette, loss of normal mediastinal contours, tracheal deviation, splaying of carina, obliteration of aortopulmonary window.
Symptoms: May be asymptomatic (incidental finding). Aortic dissection: tearing chest pain radiating to back, unequal pulses, pulse deficit. Lymphoma: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), superior vena cava syndrome.
When to Seek Care: Any mediastinal widening on chest X-ray requires urgent investigation. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate CT angiography.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Rib Fracture]
Definition: A rib fracture is a break in one or more rib bones, usually from direct trauma, appearing as a discontinuity in the rib cortex on imaging.
Causes: Blunt chest trauma (MVA, fall, assault), stress fractures (athletes, chronic cough), pathological fractures (osteoporosis, bone metastases, multiple myeloma).
X-ray Findings: Cortical discontinuity or step-deformity in rib. Subtle non-displaced fractures may be missed on plain X-ray — CT is more sensitive. Look for associated pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion.
Symptoms: Sharp localized chest pain worsening with breathing, coughing or movement, point tenderness on palpation, splinting (shallow breathing to avoid pain).
Complications: Flail chest (≥3 consecutive ribs broken in ≥2 places — paradoxical breathing), pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, pneumonia from hypoventilation.
Treatment: Analgesia (NSAIDs, opioids, intercostal nerve block), deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia. Surgical stabilization for flail chest.
When to Seek Care: Severe chest pain after trauma, difficulty breathing, SpO2 dropping, or if multiple rib fractures suspected.

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Tuberculosis (TB)]
Definition: Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can affect any organ.
Causes: Inhalation of M. tuberculosis droplets from an active TB patient. Risk factors: HIV/immunosuppression, malnutrition, crowded living, diabetes, smoking.
X-ray Findings: Primary TB: hilar lymphadenopathy, lower/mid lobe infiltrates. Reactivation TB: upper lobe infiltrates, cavitation (thick-walled cavities), fibrotic scarring, calcified granulomas (Ghon focus), miliary pattern (tiny diffuse nodules) in disseminated TB.
Symptoms: Chronic productive cough >3 weeks, hemoptysis, low-grade fever, drenching night sweats, significant weight loss, fatigue, anorexia.
Diagnosis: Sputum AFB smear and culture (gold standard), GeneXpert MTB/RIF (rapid PCR), Mantoux test/IGRA, chest X-ray, CT chest.
Treatment: Standard 6-month DOTS regimen: 2 months HRZE (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) + 4 months HR. Drug-resistant TB requires specialized longer regimens.
When to Seek Care: Chronic cough with any constitutional symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, fever) — immediate sputum testing required.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

[Disease: Lung Cancer]
Definition: Lung cancer is a malignancy arising from the epithelium of the lung, the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
Types: Non-small cell (80%): adenocarcinoma (most common, peripheral), squamous cell (central, cavitating), large cell. Small cell (20%): central, highly aggressive, paraneoplastic syndromes.
Risk Factors: Smoking (primary — 85% of cases), radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, occupational carcinogens, family history, prior lung disease.
X-ray Findings: Peripheral mass or nodule, central mass causing hilar enlargement or collapse, cavitating lesion, pleural effusion, rib destruction, mediastinal widening from lymphadenopathy.
Symptoms: Persistent cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, hoarseness, weight loss, recurrent infections, Pancoast syndrome (shoulder/arm pain from apex tumor), SVC syndrome.
Diagnosis: CT chest, PET-CT for staging, bronchoscopy + biopsy, CT-guided biopsy, molecular testing (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1) to guide targeted therapy.
When to Seek Care: Any unexplained hemoptysis, persistent cough >3 weeks, or suspicious mass — urgent specialist referral required. Do not delay.

--------------------------------------------------

[General: Normal Chest X-ray]
Definition: A normal chest X-ray shows clear lung fields, normal heart size, intact bony structures, and well-defined mediastinal contours.
Normal Findings: Clear black lung fields bilaterally, sharp costophrenic angles, cardiothoracic ratio <0.5, symmetric hilar structures, intact ribs and clavicles, trachea midline, smooth diaphragmatic contours.
What It Means: A normal chest X-ray does not rule out all lung pathology (early interstitial disease, small nodules, and pulmonary embolism may not be visible). Clinical symptoms always take precedence over imaging alone.

--------------------------------------------------

[General: Understanding Chest X-ray Results]
Definition: A chest X-ray (CXR) is a two-dimensional projection image of the thoracic structures using X-ray radiation.
How to Read: Systematically assess — airways (trachea, carina), bones (ribs, spine, clavicles), cardiac silhouette (size, shape), diaphragm (level, contour), edges (pleural space, costophrenic angles), fields (lung parenchyma density), and soft tissues.
Limitations: Overlapping structures reduce sensitivity. CT provides superior characterization. Small effusions (<200mL), small pneumothoraces, and early interstitial changes may be missed on plain X-ray.
Important Note: A chest X-ray finding always requires clinical correlation with patient symptoms, history, and examination. Never interpret imaging in isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

[General: When to Seek Emergency Care]
Emergency symptoms requiring immediate attention: Severe shortness of breath at rest, SpO2 below 90%, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), sudden sharp chest pain, tearing pain radiating to back (possible aortic dissection), loss of consciousness, cyanosis (blue lips/fingertips), severe chest trauma.
Do not delay emergency care for these symptoms. Call emergency services or go directly to the nearest emergency department.

--------------------------------------------------

[General: MedXScan AI System]
Definition: MedXScan is an AI-powered chest X-ray analysis system that uses deep learning (DenseNet-based model) to detect pulmonary and cardiac pathologies from uploaded chest X-rays.
Capabilities: Detects conditions including Pneumonia, Atelectasis, Consolidation, Pleural Effusion, Cardiomegaly, Pulmonary Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Lung Mass, Nodule, and more. Generates GradCAM heatmaps showing regions of concern. Produces automated PDF diagnostic reports.
Limitations: MedXScan is a clinical decision support tool only. It is NOT a substitute for radiologist review or physician diagnosis. Results must always be interpreted in clinical context by a qualified healthcare professional.
Accuracy: AI performance varies with image quality, patient positioning, and disease prevalence. False positives and negatives are possible.
